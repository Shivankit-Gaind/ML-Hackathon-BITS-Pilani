# ML-Hackathon-BITS-Pilani
This project involves unsupervised learning analysis on San Francisco Crime Rate Dataset for conducting an introductory hands-on session on Machine Learning in BITS Pilani a week before its technical fest APOGEE, 2017 . The crime locations are clustered on the basis of their latitudes and longitudes using three clustering techniques:

1. K-Means Clustering
2. Hierarchial Clustering
3. DB Scan

The results of the clustering are given as images (which are plots generated using matplotlib - a python library).

Python Libraries used:

1. Scikit-learn
2. Pandas
3. Numpy
4. Matplotlib
